Our Wireframe was built in Adobe XD and gave us an overview of the elments we wanted to implement as well as the Flow Diagramm. Then we started to make our first prototype including our color schema and the pictures we wanted to use.  </p>

                <li>We used a digital prototype (medium fidelity) and recorded how the users are trying to perform some tasks on the page.</li>
              <li> Number of test users: 4 in total

                    <li class="small-fontsize">  Lisa Sieverding: 26 years old, just had a depression, thus she likes to inform herself about the issue happiness and self-growth. Self-care is very important for her and she always uses perfume before she leaves the house. Furthermore, she is a social worker and thus knows how to deal with difficult life circumstances. That is why she fits perfectly into our target group, so I chose her for the prototype testing.

                    <li class="small-fontsize">  Nathalie Simon:  24 years old, works as a product designer for a German fashion brand, she works in the superficial media world and is being confronted a lot with social expectations. She always wears perfume and is very interested in the topics self-growth and mental health. That is why she fits perfectly into our target group, so I chose her for the prototype testing.

  <p>  Outcome of testing and usability issues found:
          In the following lines we will describe the outcome of the testing and usability issues. The product is effective, as the users were able to find what they wanted and what we asked them to do. Our website is efficient, because the users achieved their goals quickly and did not hesitate any time. It was engaging, but the users did not like the order of the different sites. They wanted to see the product on the first page and not the explanation about the brand or the brand values on the first page. They also mentioned that they would like to see pictures on the slide show on the first page. Furthermore, the most annoying point for them was that there was not enough contrast on the pages. Moreover, they would like the font sizes to be a bit bigger because it was hard to read, but they were not sure if this could be also solved with adding more contrast to the page. The website is error tolerant. They did not do any mistakes; everything was clear for the users. The website is easy to learn. The users could understand quickly how to operate the product. All in all, the feedback from the users regarding the website were just small distractions we can change easily. They involve changing superficial aspects like changing an order and adding pictures. Thus, the improvements do not require changing the whole concept of the product. </p>

               <h4>Recommentations</h4><p>Recommendations for improving the website based on the testing:In the following lines, according to the feedback we got from the prototype testing, I will recommend some changes to improve our website. First, we should change the order of the sites into: Home, perfume, about us, contact. Then, we should put images into the slide show. Moreover, the first page should include the product because this is the most important information for the user. On the product side we should use one big picture in the beginning (main product) and under that picture more pictures. Additionally, we should add the name of the perfume and the ingredients on the product page. Furthermore, we should add more contrast and more colours to our website, as the text is not easy to read for the users and the website looks a bit boring for them. And we should change the colour brown, as they did not like it, because they think brown is not a sexy colour. If the contrast doesn’t change the readability, we should think about making the font-size a bit bigger. We should add some pictures about the product as this is the most important information for the users. Also, on the “about us” page we should think about adding some pictures about us and explaining what exactly we are doing. The last point is that most users did not really get our call-to-action button on the first page that leads to our Instagram page. Thus, we should change the sentence on the button from “go take a look” to something like “visit our Instagram page.

               <h4>What we improved</h4><p>After taking all the feedback in consideration, we decided to apply the improvements in the prototype. For example, we put the perfume at the first page so that that will be the first thing they see. We also decided that we wanted to change our concept from online store to a pop-up store. We did this because we wanted to make our perfume more unique and make it limited. We also changed the order of the navbar, so that the Product Section is the first one to choose from to focus more on our product. On the Homepage we indicrated a section to lead the visitors to our Instagram page. We made the font-size bigger to make the visibilty and readability better. We also made the backgroundcolors more transparent to ....On the "About Us Page" we implemented a section about the background story of Morally and a section about our Team to show more .... </p>
