              <h4><br>Our Design Process</h4><p>We initiated the design process by creating a wireframe in Adobe XD that gave us an overview of the elements we wanted to implement. We also created a flow diagram to have a clear sense of navigation across different pages while creating the actual website. For creating the first prototype, we used the color scheme that we had decided upon earlier in our brand roadmap, and added the pictures that we had intended to use</p>

                <li>We used a digital prototype (medium fidelity) and recorded how the users are trying to perform some tasks on the page.</li>
              <li> Number of test users: 4 in total
                <ol>
                    <li class="small-fontsize">  Lisa Sieverding: 26 years old, just had a depression, thus she likes to inform herself about the issue happiness and self-growth. Self-care is very important for her and she always uses perfume before she leaves the house. Furthermore, she is a social worker and thus knows how to deal with difficult life circumstances. That is why she fits perfectly into our target group, so I chose her for the prototype testing.

                    <li class="small-fontsize">  Nathalie Simon:  24 years old, works as a product designer for a German fashion brand, she works in the superficial media world and is being confronted a lot with social expectations. She always wears perfume and is very interested in the topics self-growth and mental health. That is why she fits perfectly into our target group, so I chose her for the prototype testing.

  <p>  Outcome of testing and usability issues found:
          In the following lines we will describe the outcome of the testing and usability issues. The product is effective, as the users were able to find what they wanted and what we asked them to do. Our website is efficient, because the users achieved their goals quickly and did not hesitate any time. It was engaging, but the users did not like the order of the different sites. They wanted to see the product on the first page and not the explanation about the brand or the brand values on the first page. They also mentioned that they would like to see pictures on the slide show on the first page. Furthermore, the most annoying point for them was that there was not enough contrast on the pages. Moreover, they would like the font sizes to be a bit bigger because it was hard to read, but they were not sure if this could be also solved with adding more contrast to the page. The website is error tolerant. They did not do any mistakes; everything was clear for the users. The website is easy to learn. The users could understand quickly how to operate the product. All in all, the feedback from the users regarding the website were just small distractions we can change easily. They involve changing superficial aspects like changing an order and adding pictures. Thus, the improvements do not require changing the whole concept of the product. </p>

               <h4>Recommendations</h4><p>Recommendations for improving the website based on the testing: In the following lines, according to the feedback we got from the prototype testing, I will recommend some changes to improve our website. First, we should change the order of the sites into: Home, perfume, about us, contact. Then, we should put images into the slide show. Moreover, the first page should include the product because this is the most important information for the user. On the product side we should use one big picture in the beginning (main product) and under that picture more pictures. Additionally, we should add the name of the perfume and the ingredients on the product page. Furthermore, we should add more contrast and more colours to our website, as the text is not easy to read for the users and the website looks a bit boring for them. And we should change the colour brown, as they did not like it, because they think brown is not a sexy colour. If the contrast doesn’t change the readability, we should think about making the font-size a bit bigger. We should add some pictures about the product as this is the most important information for the users. Also, on the “about us” page we should think about adding some pictures about us and explaining what exactly we are doing. The last point is that most users did not really get our call-to-action button on the first page that leads to our Instagram page. Thus, we should change the sentence on the button from “go take a look” to something like “visit our Instagram page.

               <h4>What We Improved</h4><p>After taking all the feedback into consideration, we decided to implement the improvements in the prototype. For instance, we added perfumes on the home page so it is the first thing that the user's attention is directed to. We also decided that we wanted to change our concept from an online store to a pop-up store; we did this because we wanted to make our perfume more unique and make it limited. We also changed the order of the navbar, so that the Product Section is the first one to choose from, allowing us to focus more on advertising our product. Moreover, we also added a section on the homepage that could help direct users to our Instagram account; this could help improve communication between our brand and any user who is curious to learn more. We increased the font-size to make the visibilty and readability better. We also made the background colors more transparent to ensure a smooth flow is achieved while navigating the pages. Lastly, on the "About Us" page, we added a section about the background story of Morally, as well as a section displaying photographs of our team members coupled with a personal quote; this would help our users attain a deeper understanding of our brand and what it precisely stands for, while connecting on a personal level</p>

            <p>Over time we have made a few other changes such as renaming our individual pages.For example About us to Our story and we have tried to be more sales oriented on the homepage and direct visitors to our products.</p>
